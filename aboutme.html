          <p>What I am looking for towards my professional life is going to college for two years. Then study in business to open up my own record store. The experiences lead me here was working for my sisters own business. It made me realize I wanted to do my own business.

How I am looking towards these goals is going to community college for two years, Then go to FGCU for business. And, see the details on what I need to do to get in that situation. Another simple factor is just going through the steps one by one. Every success has its time, no need to be rushed.

The values I consider most necessary is staying committed, continuing on improving myself and seeing where the problem is, then resolve the issue and see where In the problem that needs to be focused on.

I hope going through college with ease and minimal problems. Afterwards pursue my dreams and achieve them.
The character traits I want to be known for is caring, determination, and just a "good friend". There are many things I want to be known for.</p>
